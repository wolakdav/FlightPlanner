# FlightPlanner — Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold to start the FlightPlanner frontend.

Quick start (Windows / cmd.exe):

```cmd
cd "c:\Users\micro\Documents\Projects\FlightPlanner\FrontEnd"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Build for production:

```cmd
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes:
- This project uses Vite and React 18 with TypeScript.
- If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server here, tell me and I'll run it for you.
